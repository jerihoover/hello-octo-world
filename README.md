Hello Humans and Aliens of GitHub! 

I'm an innovative thinker who enjoys a challenge, so I'm finding out more about what you do at GitHub. Congrats on surpassing 50 million users this year!

While looking around, I found we have some things in common: 

You're looking for an action-oriented person with a history of getting things done in complex environments to support GitHubâ€™s vision to build the home for all developers. I'm a person with deep experience designing, implementing, and analyzing the effectiveness of strategic global solutions through business process improvement, training development, project and change management. 

You're looking for a collaborator who can bring together multiple teams across the organization, while continuing to grow and scale, to build a practice for leading and managing large Support projects. I've been thriving and collaborating for the past 8 years with teams across all of Airbnb's businesses and offices to deliver on multiple objectives and key results, including the coordination of the COVID-19 response and IPO readiness.

	You're at the top of your game and I'm at the top of mine! 
	I want to work with the best of the best and I'm sure you do too. 

I think GitHub seems like the place to be to participate in a community building the future of software and making a difference in the world. I like your commitment to diversity and social impact. You seem like a good group of helpers and I'd like to talk more about how my skills fit the role of Customer Success and Support Senior Program Manager. 

Please let me know if I can nerd out with you on topics like time management, communication, management styles, or needs assessments. I'd be happy to!

Live long and prosper,

Jeri Hoover
